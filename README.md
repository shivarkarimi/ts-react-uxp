# uxp-starter-react
> Complete starter for writing UXP plugins using React and Typescript.

## Setup
```
npm install
```

The install scripts will ask you to enter in some information about your plugin. You can re-run this process with `npm run manifest` at any time.

```
npm run build
# or
npm run watch
```

During plugin development use `npm run watch` to monitor for file changes and re-bundle. Once you are happy with your plugin and are ready to publish or distribute use `npm run build` to generate the production bundle.

## Prerequisites
- [UXP DevTools](https://github.com/adobe-uxp/devtools-cli), please follow the instructions there.
- Adobe Photoshop or Adobe XD (Creative Cloud Subscription)
